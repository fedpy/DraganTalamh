The project will primarily use **development** branch for all development efforts. The **master** branch will hold the most current version of the project which will be managed by the Code Owners [@fedpy](https://github.com/fedpy/) and [@Mark-Barry](https://github.com/Mark-Barry). The website and website related assets will be kept in the **website** branch. A **scrapper** branch will be used for all development efforts of the web scrapper. Should there be a need to create a feature and/or functionality that is outside from the original project scope, a branch **features** will be used.
